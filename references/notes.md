Post Here helps you find the best place to share on Reddit. The user enters their
post and Post Here finds the subreddit that is most appropriate for that post.


**TO DO:**

1. Data:

- [X] Find data sources -> ETL  
      https://www.storybench.org/how-to-scrape-reddit-with-python/


2. Analysis:

- Initial findings
- visualization - matplot

3. Models:

- A model that uses NLP techniques to determine which subreddit has the most similar posts

- User inputs user name and they get suggestions for sub-reddit's they might like.

- Expand the model to predict the subreddit where a post would get the most upvotes.

- Display summary statistics of targeted subreddit.

3. Metrics:
